## FIRST ##  This should be done BEFORE the installation of cephadm!!!
#Setup docker log rotation:
nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "1g",
    "max-file": "3" 
  }
}


## Also, as an "even better" option, tell cephadm to use an rsyslog server:
You can pass the Docker logging configuration options to the containers deployed by cephadm by setting the CEPH_CONTAINER_EXTRA_ARGS environment variable. For example, you can set it like this:

export CEPH_CONTAINER_EXTRA_ARGS="--log-driver=syslog --log-opt syslog-address=tcp://syslog-server:514"
This will configure the containers to use remote syslog on a server named syslog-server at port 514. You can replace these values with the IP address and port number of your remote syslog server.

#Docker, not ceph, but:

# - Add net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1 to the end of the /etc/sysctl.conf file and force a reload of the file with the sudo sysctl -p command.
