#!!!WARNING!!!
# These are just my notes, and or spesific to my setup...
# This is also now well tested.
# See official docs:

#If you are on proxmox, or not using "hyperconverged" nodes, you can probably skip this:
#Stop all non-ceph dockers
# - Exclude LBs
# - Exclude DNS


#Stage 2:
#Get Ceph clients:
ceph tell mds.0 client ls > /dev/shm/tmp.CephClients 2> /dev/null

#Look at this output and make sure you can tolerate kicking the clients!
cat /dev/shm/tmp.CephClients

#Try to umount all ceph clients.
#Clients=`cat /dev/shm/tmp.CephClients | grep '"hostname":' | cut -d '"' -f 4`

#Might re-run the 'ceph tell mds.0 client ls' command to see how it looks, but we will need to kick and stuck clients:
#Evict all other clients:
#ClientIDs=`cat /dev/shm/tmp.CephClients | grep '"id":' | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d ',' -f 1`
#For each:
#ceph tell mds.0 client evict id=$ClientID
#ceph tell mds.0 client evict client_metadata.=$ClientID



#ceph osd set noout
#ceph osd set norecover 
#ceph osd set norebalance
#ceph osd set nobackfill
#ceph osd set nodown
#ceph osd set pause

#You SHOULD be safe to shutdown now....


#Restart time.
#WAIT!!!  Really, like watch ceph -s, and wait till it stops changing, THEN wait 5 more minutes.  15 If you have the time!  No joke, this is an issue!

#ceph osd unset norecover 
#WAIT!!!  Watch 'watch ceph -s', and wait till it stops changing
#ceph osd unset nobackfill
#WAIT!!!  Watch 'watch ceph -s', and wait till it stops changing

#Now we can really start things up.
#ceph osd unset noout
#ceph osd unset norebalance
#ceph osd unset nodown
#ceph osd unset pause
